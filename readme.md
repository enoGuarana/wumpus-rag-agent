# 🏹 Wumpus World: RAG Agent vs Propositional Logic

**Scientific Initiation Final Project** — Comparative analysis of agent efficiency in the Wumpus World environment.

This research evaluates the performance of two distinct AI approaches:
- **Propositional Logic Agent**: Classical symbolic reasoning based on first-order logic and inference rules
- **RAG Agent (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: LLM-based agent augmented with a structured knowledge base

## 🎯 Objective

To quantitatively and qualitatively compare the efficiency of knowledge-based agents (propositional logic) versus language model-based agents (RAG) in solving partially observable environments, using the Wumpus World as a benchmark.

## 📊 Key Metrics

| Metric | Propositional Logic | RAG Agent |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| Success Rate | X% | Y% |
| Average Steps to Gold | X | Y |
| Inference Time | X ms | Y ms |
| Adaptability to Changes | Low | High |
